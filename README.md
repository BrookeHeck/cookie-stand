# Salmon Cookies - Lab 7

## Pat's Famous Salmon Cookie's
I built an app that displays information about Pat's multiple stores and shows hourly sales data for each of those stores. The webpage gives a little more info about the cookies along with contanct information so the user can easily find a store nearby them. The data page currently uses estimate customer and cookie sales to calculate how many cookies are sold hourly and computes the total sold. The purpose of this app is help Pat reach more customers and to have an easy to read table of sales data so he can make future decisions about stores.

### Reflections and Comments
This was my first time using constructors in JS. I have coded in Java before, so I may have jumped ahead and used a class with a constructor method. Once you get the hang of classes and constructors they are an amazing coding tool and allowed me to easily create new instances for each store.
